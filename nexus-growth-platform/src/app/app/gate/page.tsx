/**
 * THE QUEUE.
 *
 * The screen the catalogue's oversight promise points at. Two sentences on a
 * public price list say a client can read what an automation intends to do
 * before it does it, pull anything out, and see afterwards what happened —
 * and none of that means anything without somewhere to look.
 *
 * Built before either automation exists, so it opens empty. That is the right
 * order: a queue added after a loop has been running is a queue with a gap in
 * its history exactly where the trust was supposed to be.
 *
 * WHAT THE EMPTY STATE HAS TO DO
 *   Say why it is empty without implying something is broken, and show what
 *   *would* appear here, because the promise is easier to believe when the
 *   list of gated actions is visible before anything is queued.
