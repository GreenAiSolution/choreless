/**
 * The only conversion endpoint on the site.
 *
 * DIRECTION
 *   Somebody read a page of four-figure monthly upgrades and picked the ones
 *   they want. Sending them to a login form at that exact moment throws the
 *   intent away, so this takes their details and their shortlist and gets it in
 *   front of a human the same day.
 *
 * BLUEPRINTS
 *   Deliberately touches NO database, NO auth and NO Stripe. Those are the three
 *   things most likely to be unconfigured on a fresh deploy, and this is
 *   precisely the path that has to survive that. It needs only the notify layer,
 *   which itself degrades to a log line rather than failing.
 *
 *   The quote is recomputed here from `UPGRADES` rather than trusting any total
 *   the browser sent. A posted price is user input.
