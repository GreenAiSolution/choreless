/**
 * The gate sweep. Every five minutes (see vercel.json).
 *
 * Closes review windows, runs what has been released, and lapses what nobody
 * got to. Separate from the hourly night-shift cron on purpose: the shortest
 * review window on the board is five minutes, and a queue that says "sends in
 * five minutes" while being swept hourly is showing a countdown attached to
 * nothing. `gate.test.ts` reads this schedule out of vercel.json and fails if
 * it stops matching `SWEEP_INTERVAL_MINUTES`.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction. Every transition inside `sweep` is guarded by the
 * state it moves from, so a retry — and Vercel does retry — cannot double-send.
 *
 * No model call anywhere in this path. The gate has to behave identically on a
 * day the Anthropic API is down, because "the model was unavailable" is not a
 * reason a client's invoice should go out unreviewed, or fail to.
