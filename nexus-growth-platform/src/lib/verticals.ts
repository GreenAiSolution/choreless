/**
 * Vertical packs — the same system, pre-tuned per trade.
 *
 * DIRECTION
 *   A generic "AI agent platform" makes a roofer do the translation work. A
 *   "Roofing Growth Desk" arrives already speaking their language. Identical
 *   modules, identical price — but the qualification rubric already knows what
 *   an insurance claim is, and the objection drill already knows the customer
 *   is getting three estimates. That is the whole idea: same product, far less
 *   distance between buying it and getting value from it.
 *
 * BLUEPRINTS
 *   A pack never adds or removes modules — the tier decides that. A pack only
 *   overrides *content*: the three ASSET bodies (voice profile, qualification
 *   rubric, escalation matrix) and any PLAYBOOK starter prompts it has a better
 *   version of. `verticals.test.ts` enforces that every override key names a
 *   module that actually exists, so a rename in systems.ts can't silently
 *   orphan a pack's copy.
 *
 * A note on the numbers below: `typicalJobValue` and the response windows in
 * each escalation matrix are deliberately conservative starting points for the
 * client to edit on day one, not researched benchmarks. They are framed that
 * way everywhere they surface.
