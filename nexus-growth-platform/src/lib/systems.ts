/**
 * System blueprints — what each subscription tier actually deploys.
 *
 * DIRECTION
 *   A tier is not a price, it is a system. The moment a payment clears, every
 *   INSTANT module below is provisioned automatically (see lib/provisioning.ts)
 *   and the client can use it immediately; every BUILD module is human work
 *   scheduled during the one-time build.
 *
 * BLUEPRINTS
 *   Tiers compose: SCALE_MODULES spreads LAUNCH_MODULES, COMMAND_MODULES
 *   spreads SCALE_MODULES. Upgrading is therefore always additive — a client
 *   never loses a system they were provisioned. `systems.test.ts` enforces the
 *   superset property, unique keys, and that the AGENT modules in a blueprint
 *   match exactly the agents the catalog unlocks for that plan (the two files
 *   drift otherwise, and the client would be promised an agent they can't run).
