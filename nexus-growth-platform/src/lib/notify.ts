/**
 * Notifications — the tap on the shoulder.
 *
 * DIRECTION
 *   Almost everything this platform does happens while nobody is looking. The
 *   night shift writes a brief at 3am, the Spend Watch finds a dead account on
 *   a Sunday, a client files a request at 11pm. Until now none of it told
 *   anyone. A system that only works if you remember to go and check it is a
 *   system people stop checking.
 *
 * BLUEPRINTS
 *   `renderNotification` is pure — kind and payload in, subject and body out —
 *   so every template is tested without a mail server. `sendNotification` does
 *   the delivery and is fire-and-forget by construction: it catches everything
 *   and returns a status. A failing mail server must never break a client's
 *   request submission or fail a Stripe webhook.
 *
 *   With no SMTP configured it logs and reports "skipped", exactly like
 *   lib/webhooks.ts. The app has always had to run without secrets.
